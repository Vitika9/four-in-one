An android app which I made in first year of graduation to learn basics of android development.
App has four features- News,Memes,Dice and Music player.

What did I learn?
-Making simple layouts with XML
-Using API
-Using RecyclerView
-Using Android MediaPlayer APIs to play audio or video from media files stored in application's resources (raw resources),
